# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
This analysis was conducted to determine a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup

## Results

### Data Preprocessing
- Target variable: IS-SUCCESSFUL
- Features: APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, and ASK_AMT 
- Features removed from the input data: EIN and NAME

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- I selected 80 neurons for my first layer and 30 for the second layer. 
- I was not able to achieve the target model performance.
- I tried to increase the model performance by 1) selecting a different number of hidden notes 2) removing certain input features 3) selecting a different number of neurons.

## Summary
I was not able to achieve the target accuracy. Perhaps I could increase it by removing additional features from the dataset.
